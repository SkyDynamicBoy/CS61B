All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: I find in the grow() funtion, I use a redundant 'if-else', but I can try the feture of circular minus and plus in my arraycopy.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A:I use helper function for many repeated and general code.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A:I abuse 'if-else' for somewhere not need.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A:

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A:

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A:Try thinking all methods. (1)Find out shared code block to write some helper function. (2)Find special case to avoid test error.
